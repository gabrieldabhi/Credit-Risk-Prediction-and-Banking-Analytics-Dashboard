# Credit-Risk-Prediction-and-Banking-Analytics-Dashboard
This project builds an end-to-end credit risk analytics system to predict loan default, generate customer risk scores, and visualize portfolio risk using Power BI.  The solution simulates a real banking environment where machine learning supports lending decisions and risk monitoring.

Tech Stack:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy)
- Power BI
- Logistic Regression
- Data Visualization & Business KPIs

Workflow:
1. Loaded and explored real banking loan data  
2. Built preprocessing pipeline for numeric and categorical features  
3. Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict default probability  
4. Generated risk scores and segmented customers into risk buckets  
5. Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and high-risk segments  


Key Outputs:
- Risk Score for each customer  
- Risk Buckets: Low, Medium, High, Very High  
- Default Rate by Risk Category  
- High-Risk Customer Identification

Business Value:
This system helps banks:
- Reduce default exposure  
- Prioritize risky loans  
- Monitor portfolio health  
- Make data-driven approval decisions
